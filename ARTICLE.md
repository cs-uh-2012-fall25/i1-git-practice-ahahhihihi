# Interesting Article: Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming

[Read "Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming" by Charles Scalfani](https://cscalfani.medium.com/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53#.a1f5rbp2r)

## Why I Find It Interesting

This article challenges the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and discusses its limitations, illustrated through concrete code examples and real-world analogies. Scalfani argues for a shift toward functional programming, explaining how inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism—the pillars of OOP—can lead to fragile and overly complex code bases.

Over the past summer, I watched several videos about data-oriented design, which also questioned traditional OOP approaches. Reading this article reinforced the “paradigm shift” I’ve been experiencing in how I think about code structure and problem solving. I now better appreciate why understanding data flow, composition, and modular design can unlock new possibilities in software engineering.
